"""The module contains functions and classes for building iterative signal reconstruction applications for MRI.

It provides convenient simulation and sampling functions, such as poisson-disc sampling function, and shepp-logan phantom generation function. It also implements common MRI reconstruction applications, including SENSE reconstruction, l1-wavelet reconstruction, total-variation reconstruction, and JSENSE reconstruction.
